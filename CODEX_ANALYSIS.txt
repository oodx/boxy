CODEX ANALYSIS REQUEST: Boxy Library API for Room Runtime Integration
================================================================================

Date: 2025-09-25
Project: Boxy - Unicode Box Drawing Utility â†’ Library API
Analysis Type: Architecture Review & Quality Assessment

================================================================================
1. PROJECT CONTEXT & BACKGROUND
================================================================================

Boxy is a Rust CLI tool that draws Unicode boxes around text content with proper
emoji/CJK width handling. It supports themes, multiple box styles (rounded, double,
heavy, ASCII), and complex text layout features.

KEY CONTEXT DOCUMENTS (Read in this order for zero-context understanding):
1. README.md                              - Project overview and capabilities
2. docs/procs/PROCESS.txt                 - Development workflow and status
3. docs/rsb/MODULE_SPEC.md                - RSB architecture patterns we follow
4. docs/ref/WIDTH_CALCULATION.md          - Critical Unicode width handling
5. docs/ref/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONS_PROTECTION.md - Protected calculation logic

================================================================================
2. THE PROBLEM
================================================================================

REQUESTER: Room Runtime Project (layout engine)
BLOCKER: Room Runtime needs boxy's precise Unicode box drawing and width
calculations but CANNOT use ANSI color codes because it positions boxes in
a terminal layout and applies its own styling system.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Pure box geometry (Unicode characters only, NO ANSI escape codes)
- Precise width calculations for emoji/CJK/grapheme clusters
- Dynamic component updates (modify just Header, Footer, Status independently)
- Background color support (new feature request)
- First-class width/height calculation APIs
- Ability to completely bypass theme system

ARCHITECTURAL CHALLENGE:
The existing boxy architecture has color/theme rendering tightly coupled with
box drawing logic (see src/visual/utils.rs:224-280 render_box_with_width).
Every draw operation requires color configuration.

================================================================================
3. THE SOLUTION
================================================================================

Created a new Library API module (src/api/) that provides clean separation of
concerns while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing CLI.

ARCHITECTURE PATTERN: Adapter/Bridge Pattern
- Keep existing boxy CLI unchanged
- Add new api module exposing building blocks
- Import from existing internals (migration path)
- Room Runtime ignores theming entirely

MODULE STRUCTURE:
src/api/
â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs       - Orchestrator with curated public API
â”œâ”€â”€ geometry.rs  - Pure width/emoji calculations (no colors)
â”œâ”€â”€ layout.rs    - Component builders (Header, Footer, Status, Body)
â””â”€â”€ theming.rs   - Optional color application + background colors (NEW)

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:
1. RSB MODULE_SPEC compliance (no cross-module color dependencies)
2. Builder pattern for flexible component construction
3. Protected calculation macros re-exported for layout engines
4. Background color feature added (ANSI, RGB, Named, Hex support)
5. Plain vs Themed renderer pattern for consumer choice

================================================================================
4. KEY CODE FILES TO REVIEW
================================================================================

PRIMARY REVIEW TARGETS:
1. src/api/mod.rs                     - Main API surface and exports
2. src/api/geometry.rs                - Width calculations and Unicode handling
3. src/api/layout.rs                  - Component builders without color coupling
4. src/api/theming.rs                 - Optional theming with background colors
5. examples/room_runtime_demo.rs      - Usage demonstration and validation

SUPPORTING CONTEXT:
6. src/width_plugin.rs:214            - get_display_width() implementation
7. src/visual/utils.rs:224-280        - Original coupled rendering (for contrast)
8. src/visual/calc_macros.rs          - Protected calculation macros
9. .eggs/egg.5.room-runtime-library-api-architecture.txt - Architecture analysis
10. .eggs/egg.1.boxy-api-review.txt   - China's review (4.5/5 stars)

================================================================================
5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

UNICODE WIDTH HANDLING:
- Uses unicode-width crate for base calculations
- Strips ANSI codes before measurement (src/api/geometry.rs:76)
- Handles emoji (ðŸŒŸ = 2 columns), CJK (ä¸­æ–‡ = 2 chars, 4 columns)
- TextMetrics struct provides comprehensive width data

COMPONENT SYSTEM:
- HeaderBuilder, FooterBuilder, StatusBuilder, BodyBuilder
- Each component builds independently with no color dependency
- Components return ComponentLayout with pure Unicode content
- Room Runtime can position/style each component separately

BACKGROUND COLOR INNOVATION:
- BackgroundColor enum supports None, ANSI(u8), RGB, Named, Hex
- apply_background_color() generates proper escape sequences
- Completely optional - Room Runtime can ignore entirely

MIGRATION PATH:
The API imports from existing boxy internals:
- get_display_width from width_plugin
- BoxStyle constants from visual module
- Protected macros from calc_macros
This allows gradual internal migration to use the same API.

================================================================================
6. VALIDATION & TESTING
================================================================================

DEMO EXECUTION:
```bash
cargo run --example room_runtime_demo
```

DEMO VALIDATES:
- Emoji width: "Hello ðŸŒŸ World ä¸­æ–‡" = 19 columns âœ“
- Pure Unicode output (no ANSI in layout) âœ“
- Component independence (4 separate components) âœ“
- Background colors working (all 5 types) âœ“
- Room Runtime use case (plain renderer) âœ“

TEST COVERAGE:
- Unit tests in each API module
- Integration demo showing end-to-end usage
- China's architectural review (4.5/5 stars)

================================================================================
7. ARCHITECTURAL IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE BENEFITS:
- Unblocks Room Runtime project
- Zero breaking changes to existing CLI
- Adds requested background color feature

STRATEGIC VALUE:
- Creates bridge for internal modernization
- Theme engine can become optional plugin
- Sets foundation for boxy as library-first tool
- Enables other layout engines to use boxy

TECHNICAL DEBT ADDRESSED:
- Begins decoupling of theme from rendering
- Provides cleaner separation of concerns
- Establishes pattern for future modularization

================================================================================
8. QUALIFYING QUESTIONS FOR CODEX
================================================================================

Please review this implementation and provide feedback on:

1. ARCHITECTURAL SOUNDNESS
   - Is the adapter/bridge pattern appropriate here?
   - Are there hidden coupling issues we missed?
   - Will this scale for other consumers beyond Room Runtime?

2. API DESIGN QUALITY
   - Is the API surface intuitive and well-organized?
   - Are the builder patterns implemented correctly?
   - Should we expose more/fewer internals?

3. UNICODE HANDLING CORRECTNESS
   - Are we handling all Unicode edge cases properly?
   - Is the width calculation approach robust?
   - Any concerns with grapheme cluster handling?

4. PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS
   - Will the abstraction layers impact performance?
   - Should we benchmark the API vs direct usage?
   - Are there optimization opportunities?

5. MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
   - What features would other layout engines need?
   - Should we add more layout constraints?
   - Is the component system flexible enough?

6. CODE QUALITY & STANDARDS
   - Does this follow Rust best practices?
   - RSB MODULE_SPEC compliance assessment?
   - Documentation completeness?

7. POTENTIAL BUGS OR EDGE CASES
   - Truncation logic concerns?
   - Alignment calculation issues?
   - Color escape sequence problems?

8. MIGRATION STRATEGY
   - Is the bridge architecture sound for gradual migration?
   - Should we refactor the CLI to use this API immediately?
   - Risk assessment for internal adoption?

================================================================================
9. SUCCESS CRITERIA
