# Continue Log – perf/render-write + Technical Debt Analysis

## Summary
- `RenderTarget` now streams into any `std::io::Write` sink; the CLI path locks `stdout` instead of allocating an intermediate `String`.
- Snapshot coverage for `render_to_string` lives in `tests/render_snapshots.rs` with fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` to catch accidental byte regressions.
- Roadmap synced (Milestone 1.7 marked complete; height milestone flagged as done) and README/docs updated to advertise streaming + height features.
- Bench snapshots refreshed earlier (`meta/snaps/`), full test suite continues to pass.
- **NEW**: Comprehensive technical debt analysis completed by China & Tina with actionable task tickets.

## Current Branch
- `perf/render-write`

## Latest Benchmarks
- Rounded: ~1.21 ms (down from ~1.39 ms).
- Normal-long: ~1.26 ms.
- Heavy-wide: ~1.18 ms.
- Baseline stored with `cargo bench --bench status_render -- --save-baseline buffer-stream`.

## Technical Debt Analysis (NEW)
- **China's Golden Egg**: Project architecture wisdom consolidated into comprehensive FAQ
- **Tina's Red Egg**: RSB compliance (35% → 90% needed) + test coverage analysis via test.sh
- **Task Tickets Created**:
  - CHINA-01 through CHINA-12 (architecture, performance, UX debt)
  - TEST-01 through TEST-18 (RSB compliance, testing infrastructure, automation)
- **YAML→TOML Migration Plan**: Complete strategy documented in `docs/YAML_TOML_MIGRATION.txt`

## Pre-M3 Critical Path
High priority technical debt that should be addressed before M3:
- **CHINA-01**: Theme System Architecture Cleanup (LARGE effort)
- **CHINA-02**: Theme Inheritance Engine Critical Bug Fix (MEDIUM effort)
- **CHINA-05**: Library API Ergonomics Enhancement (LARGE effort)
- **TEST-01, TEST-02, TEST-03**: Benchmark integration & performance regression detection
- **TEST-05 through TEST-08**: RSB architecture compliance (65% gap to close)

## What's Next
- **Immediate**: Review and prioritize technical debt tickets (CHINA-XX, TEST-XX)
- **[M2-010]**: Refresh CLI `--help` output for height/streaming features
- **[M3-009..011]**: Execute YAML→TOML migration with backward compatibility
- **Pre-M3**: Address critical technical debt from China/Tina analysis
- **[M5-002a]**: Add `height` Cargo feature gate during feature-flag milestone

## Handy Commands
```bash
# rebuild + tests
cargo fmt
cargo test

# run showcase
bin/test.sh run perfect

# benchmark and compare
cargo bench --bench status_render -- --baseline buffer-stream
```
