# TEST_ROADMAP - Pantheonâ†’Boxy Test Pattern Adaptation

**Mission**: Retrofit sophisticated pantheon test framework for Boxy's complex API

*"Transform pantheon testing treasures into Boxy-specific verification excellence"*

---

## Current Test Architecture Analysis

### Inherited Pantheon Pattern Structure âœ…
**SOURCE**: `bin/test.sh` - Unified test entry point
- **Pattern**: Declarative test registry with theme-aware output
- **Tests Available**: `uat`, `ceremony`, `minimal`, `boxy-demo`
- **Architecture**: Root coordination â†’ specific test execution
- **Value**: Professional test interface with boxy integration

### Test Directory Structure
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ misc/           # Development and integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ uat/           # User Acceptance Testing ceremonies  
â””â”€â”€ [root files]   # Utility scripts
```

**Key Insight**: Two-tier system - `misc/` for technical tests, `uat/` for user ceremonies

---

## Pantheonâ†’Boxy Adaptation Strategy

### Phase 1: Baseline Test System (PRIORITY 1)
**Objective**: Get test.sh working with current Boxy state

#### 1.1 test.sh Entry Point Verification
- [x] **DISCOVERED**: test.sh already references boxy binary properly
- [x] **CONFIRMED**: Theme-aware output using boxy itself for display
- **TASK**: Verify test.sh runs cleanly with current build

#### 1.2 Minimal Test Validation  
**File**: `tests/misc/sanity-test.sh`
- **Pattern**: Build verification + basic functionality tests
- **Current State**: Tests boxy binary with emoji, colors, styles
- **Adaptation Needed**: None - already Boxy-specific
- **Verification**: Should work with current build

#### 1.3 Remove Pure Pantheon Dependencies
**TARGETS FOR CLEANUP**:
```bash
# Files likely containing pantheon-specific code:
tests/misc/uat-ceremonies.sh  # May reference pantheon concepts
tests/uat/ceremony.sh         # Likely pantheon ceremony patterns
```

**Method**: Lucas review to identify:
- Pure pantheon concepts â†’ remove or abstract
- Valuable testing patterns â†’ adapt for Boxy API
- Infrastructure code â†’ keep as-is

## Phase 2: Test Pattern Extraction & Adaptation

### Pantheon Testing Treasures to Preserve

#### 2.1 UAT Ceremony Framework
**VALUE**: Professional user acceptance testing structure
- **Source**: `tests/misc/uat-ceremonies.sh`
- **Pattern**: Suite boundaries, step-by-step verification, visual ceremonies
- **Adaptation**: Replace pantheon operations with Boxy API tests
- **Keep**: Ceremony structure, visual presentation, step verification

#### 2.2 Theme-Aware Test Output
**VALUE**: Tests use boxy itself for beautiful output presentation
- **Pattern**: Conditional boxy usage for enhanced display
- **Implementation**: `has_boxy` checks â†’ themed output vs plain fallback
- **Adaptation**: Perfect as-is - already Boxy-focused

#### 2.3 Test Registry System
**VALUE**: Declarative test organization in test.sh
- **Pattern**: Associative array mapping test names to files
- **Current**: 4 test categories with clear descriptions
- **Adaptation**: Update descriptions and add Boxy-specific test categories

---

## Phase 3: Boxy-Specific Test Development

### 3.1 API Surface Testing
**NEW TESTS NEEDED**:
```bash
# Core Boxy functionality tests
tests/api/box-rendering.sh      # Box drawing, sizing, alignment
tests/api/theme-system.sh       # Theme loading, application, switching  
tests/api/color-management.sh   # Color parsing, application, combinations
tests/api/style-variations.sh   # Border styles, corner styles
tests/api/layout-engine.sh      # Text layout, width calculation, wrapping
```

### 3.2 Integration Testing
**ADAPTATION TARGETS**:
```bash
# Enhance existing integration tests
tests/misc/integration_tests.rs     # Already exists - enhance for Boxy
tests/misc/theme_management_tests.rs # Already exists - validate current impl
tests/misc/performance_test.sh       # Keep performance focus for Boxy
```

### 3.3 User Experience Testing  
**CEREMONY ADAPTATIONS**:
```bash
# Convert pantheon ceremonies to Boxy demonstrations
tests/uat/boxy-showcase.sh          # Full Boxy capability demonstration
tests/uat/theme-gallery.sh          # Visual theme testing ceremony
tests/uat/edge-case-validation.sh   # Complex input validation
```

## Implementation Phases

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Baseline (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
1. **Lucas Review**: Analyze pantheon test patterns for Boxy adaptation
2. **Cleanup**: Remove pure pantheon dependencies  
3. **Verify**: Ensure test.sh works with current Boxy build
4. **Document**: What works, what needs adaptation

### ðŸ”§ Phase 2: Pattern Adaptation
1. **Extract**: Valuable testing patterns from pantheon tests
2. **Abstract**: Generic ceremony/UAT frameworks for Boxy use
3. **Retrofit**: Pantheon test infrastructure for Boxy API
4. **Validate**: Adapted tests work with current Boxy state

### ðŸš€ Phase 3: Boxy-Specific Enhancement  
1. **Develop**: New test categories for Boxy's unique features
2. **Ceremony**: Create UAT ceremonies showcasing Boxy capabilities
3. **Performance**: Establish Boxy-specific performance baselines
4. **Integration**: Full test suite integration with build process

## Key Adaptation Principles

### Pattern Preservation Philosophy
- **KEEP**: Testing infrastructure, ceremony frameworks, visual presentation
- **ADAPT**: Test content from pantheon operations â†’ Boxy API calls
- **REMOVE**: Pure pantheon concepts that don't apply to Boxy
- **ENHANCE**: Add Boxy-specific test categories and validations

### Quality Standards
- **Professional Interface**: Maintain test.sh unified entry point
- **Visual Excellence**: Preserve theme-aware test output
- **User Ceremonies**: Keep UAT ceremony structure for acceptance testing  
- **Technical Precision**: Ensure tests verify actual Boxy functionality

### Implementation Discipline
- **Lucas-Led Analysis**: Engineering review of patterns before adaptation
- **Surgical Changes**: Adapt patterns, don't rebuild from scratch
- **Verification-First**: Each adaptation must prove value before expansion
- **Boxy-Focused**: Every test must serve Boxy's API and user needs
