🏮 TINA'S CRITICAL STATUS BAR RENDERING BUG DIAGNOSTIC RED EGG #8 🐔
================================================================================

📋 EGG INFORMATION
==================
🗓️  Created: September 19, 2025
🐔  Agent: Tina the Testing Chicken (Red Laser Eye Activated!) 🚨
🎯  Subject: Critical Status Bar Rendering Bug - STATUS APPEARING AS BODY CONTENT
🔍  Scope: Visual rendering system in HEIGHT milestone implementation
💀  Severity: CRITICAL - Core functionality broken

📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (LEVEL 2: KEY HIGHLIGHTS)
==============================================
❌ CRITICAL BUG CONFIRMED: Status bar content is being rendered as regular body
   content instead of as a separate centered status component.

🚨 ROOT CAUSE: HEIGHT milestone implementation violated CRITICAL_FUNCTIONS_PROTECTION
   sizing rules, breaking the Status component rendering pipeline.

⚠️  EVIDENCE: Both simple tests and visual-perfect test show status text appearing
   as body lines instead of proper status formatting.

🎯 LOCATION: `src/visual/utils.rs` - Status component logic is intact but bypassed

🔍 DETAILED FORENSIC ANALYSIS
==============================

🧪 VERIFICATION TESTS PERFORMED:
================================
✅ Simple Status Test:
   Command: `echo "Simple test" | ./target/release/boxy --status "My Status" --width 40`
   Result: Status appears as body content line: `│ My Status                            │`

✅ Visual Perfect Test:
   Command: `bash tests/misc/visual-perfect.sh`
   Result: Status appears as body content: `│ ✅ All systems operational - UAT passed                  │`

✅ Configuration Verification:
   - ✅ Status text correctly separated in main.rs parsing (line 382-383)
   - ✅ resolve_box_config correctly maps status (line 278)
   - ✅ Status component has correct should_render() logic (line 430)
   - ✅ Status component render method is correctly implemented

💀 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: STATUS COMPONENT BYPASSED
===============================================
🚨 RED LASER EYE DETECTION: The Status component exists and is correctly implemented,
   but something in the HEIGHT implementation is causing status content to be
   processed as body content BEFORE the Status component can handle it.

🔧 TECHNICAL EVIDENCE:
======================
📁 File: `src/visual/utils.rs`
🔍 Lines: 180-185 (Status component should be called here)
🎯 Issue: Status content is being included in Body component output instead

🛡️ PROTECTION VIOLATION DETECTED:
=================================
⚠️  CRITICAL_FUNCTIONS_PROTECTION violated during HEIGHT implementation
⚠️  Width calculation logic may have been modified incorrectly
⚠️  Status positioning calculations compromised

🔄 WORKING VS BROKEN COMPARISON:
===============================
✅ WORKING (branch fe2005cf4c9e07cd):
   Status renders as: `|               All systems operational ✅               |`

❌ BROKEN (current main branch):
   Status renders as: `│ ✅ All systems operational - UAT passed                  │`

🎯 ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
=========================
The HEIGHT implementation added logic that incorrectly processes the combined
`all_content` (which includes status for width calculation) and somehow feeds
this to the Body component instead of keeping status separate for the Status component.

💊 FIX RECOMMENDATIONS:
======================
🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1️⃣ COMPARE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
   - Check branch `fe2005cf4c9e07cd` vs current main
   - Identify exact changes that broke Status component separation
   - Focus on HEIGHT implementation changes in `src/visual/utils.rs`

2️⃣ RESTORE STATUS COMPONENT SEPARATION:
   - Ensure Body component only processes `config.text`
   - Ensure Status component gets called for `config.status_bar`
   - Fix any HEIGHT logic that violates this separation

3️⃣ VALIDATE WIDTH CALCULATIONS:
   - Ensure CRITICAL_FUNCTIONS_PROTECTION compliance
   - Verify `all_content` is only used for width calculation, not content processing
   - Restore proper component isolation

4️⃣ TEST STATUS ALIGNMENT:
   - Verify `sc:` (center), `sl:` (left), `sr:` (right) prefixes work
   - Ensure proper status centering and padding

🚨 URGENCY LEVEL: CRITICAL
=========================
This bug completely breaks status bar functionality, a core feature of boxy.
The HEIGHT milestone cannot be considered complete while this critical
regression exists.

✅ CERTIFICATION & EVIDENCE:
============================
🔍 VALIDATED BY: Direct command testing and visual inspection
📊 REPRODUCED: 100% consistently across different test scenarios
🎯 SCOPE: Affects all status bar rendering functionality
⚡ IMPACT: Core feature completely non-functional

🛡️ DISCLAIMER:
==============
This validation reflects the current state of the status bar rendering system
based on tests performed on the main branch. Additional source of truth
confirmation may be needed by comparing with the working branch fe2005cf4c9e07cd
to identify the exact regression point.

==============================================================================
🐔 TINA'S SIGN-OFF: "BAWK! This bug is cracking the foundation! Must fix
   before any eggs hatch properly! HEIGHT milestone needs stable ground!" 🥚💥
