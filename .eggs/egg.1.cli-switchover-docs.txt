= CHINA'S CLI SWITCHOVER DOCUMENTATION REVIEW EGG >Z
===============================================

## Executive Summary
The CHINA-05A Phase 3 CLI Switchover requires a meticulous migration of the CLI system while maintaining 100% backward compatibility, with special focus on protected icon logic.

## Critical Documentation for Review
1. `/docs/procs/CHINA-05A-PHASE3-PLAN.md` - HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. `/docs/rsb/features/FEATURES_CLI.md` - Secondary Priority
3. `/src/main.rs` (Lines 717-736) - Protected Icon Logic Implementation
4. `API_README.md` - API Integration Details

## Icon Positioning Logic - Key Findings
- CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Icons must prepend to titles, NOT body content
- Current protected icon logic is in `main.rs`, lines 717-736
- Uses `apply_icon_to_text!` macro for icon positioning
- RISK AREA: Icon spacing was previously described as a "NIGHTMARE to get right"

## Knowledge Gaps to Address
1. Exact implementation of `apply_icon_to_text!` macro behavior
2. Precise rules for icon positioning with different input types
3. Edge cases in icon/title handling
4. Performance implications of icon positioning

## Backward Compatibility Checklist
 Preserve all existing CLI flag behaviors
 Maintain identical output formatting
 Keep icon spacing consistent
 No performance regression >5%

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Review `main.rs` protected icon implementation
2. Create comprehensive regression test cases
3. Validate icon positioning in multiple scenarios
4. Document current icon logic before migration

## Disclaimer
This egg represents a snapshot of documentation review. Additional investigation and validation are required to ensure complete migration success.
