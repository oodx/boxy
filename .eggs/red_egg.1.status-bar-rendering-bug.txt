| üö® RED EGG ALERT: CRITICAL RENDERING BUG DETECTED!                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================
The status bar content is being INCORRECTLY INCLUDED in the body component
instead of rendering as a separate status component. This is caused by a
DESIGN FLAW in the width calculation logic that concatenates ALL content
(including status) into a single string for width calculation, which then
gets passed to the Body component.

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: TWO-PART PROBLEM
===================================

üêõ PRIMARY BUG: Status Content Contamination
---------------------------------------------
Location: `/src/visual/utils.rs` lines 140-149 in `draw_box()` function

PROBLEMATIC CODE:
```rust
// Calculate width considering ALL content (text, title, status)
let mut all_content = config.text.clone();
if let Some(title) = &config.title {
    all_content.push('\n');
    all_content.push_str(title);
}
if let Some(status_bar) = &config.status_bar {
    all_content.push('\n');
    all_content.push_str(status_bar);  // ‚ö†Ô∏è BUG: Status added to body content
}
```

üî• IMPACT: The `all_content` variable containing status text gets used by
`calculate_box_width()` which passes it through to the Body component's
`compose_content_lines()` method, causing status content to appear as body text.

üîß SECONDARY ISSUE: Width Calculation Logic Flaw
--------------------------------------------------
The width calculation should ONLY consider the content that will actually be
rendered by each component, NOT concatenate everything together.

EVIDENCE FROM VISUAL TEST
========================
‚úÖ BROKEN OUTPUT (Current):
`‚îÇ ‚úÖ All systems operational - UAT passed                  ‚îÇ`
(Status appears as regular body content line)

‚úÖ EXPECTED OUTPUT (fe2005cf4c9e07cd branch):
`|               All systems operational ‚úÖ               |`
(Status appears as centered status bar component)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
==================
During the HEIGHT milestone implementation, the width calculation logic was
modified to concatenate ALL content for width calculation. However, this
violates the component separation principle where:

1. Body component should only handle text + title
2. Status component should handle status bar independently
3. Width calculation should consider components separately

CODE FLOW ANALYSIS
==================
1. `draw_box()` concatenates status into `all_content` (lines 141-149)
2. `all_content` passed to `calculate_box_width()` (line 151)
3. Body component receives config with status-contaminated text
4. Body component's `compose_content_lines()` processes ALL lines including status
5. Status renders as body content instead of separate component

RECOMMENDED FIX STRATEGY
=======================
üéØ **IMMEDIATE FIX**: Remove status from width calculation concatenation

**Step 1**: Modify lines 140-149 to NOT include status in `all_content`
```rust
// Calculate width considering text and title only
let mut content_for_width = config.text.clone();
if let Some(title) = &config.title {
    content_for_width.push('\n');
    content_for_width.push_str(title);
}
// DO NOT add status here - it's handled by Status component
```

**Step 2**: Use separate width calculation for status component if needed
**Step 3**: Verify component separation is maintained

TESTING VERIFICATION
===================
‚úÖ Test command: `./bin/test.sh run visual-perfect`
‚úÖ Look for status content appearing in separate status line (centered)
‚úÖ Verify status is NOT appearing as body content

CERTIFICATION
============
üêî **TINA'S CERTIFICATION**: I have identified the exact source of the status
bar rendering bug with high confidence. The issue is in the width calculation
logic that incorrectly includes status content in the body content stream.

This is a clear violation of component separation principles and can be fixed
by removing status content from the `all_content` concatenation used for
width calculation.

DISCLAIMER
=========
This validation reflects the state of the files reviewed on 2025-09-19.
Additional testing may be needed to verify the fix implementation and ensure
no regression in width calculation logic. The actual terminal rendering may
vary based on terminal settings and environment variables.

EGG METADATA
============
- Bug Type: Component Separation Violation
- Severity: Critical (visual component failure)
- Files Affected: src/visual/utils.rs (lines 140-149)
- Fix Complexity: Low (targeted line removal)
- Risk Level: Low (isolated change)
