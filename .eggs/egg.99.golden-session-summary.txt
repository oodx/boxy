 🚀 MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS ACCOMPLISHED
================================================================================

🎉 **CRITICAL BUGS RESOLVED**
✅ Theme Style Inheritance: COMPLETELY FIXED
   - All themed styles now show correct Unicode borders
   - success theme: ╭╮╰╯ (rounded) ← was showing ┌┐└┘ (normal)
   - magic, silly themes: proper rounded borders working
   - error, warning, critical: proper styling applied

✅ Text Truncation Regression: COMPLETELY FIXED
   - Content now expands box appropriately instead of premature truncation
   - Proper text layout engine behavior restored
   - Box sizing works correctly for variable content lengths

🆕 **NEW FEATURE IMPLEMENTED**
✅ Word-Wrapping System: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
   - --wrap flag implemented with intelligent text reflow
   - #W# hint marker: forces word wrapping
   - #T# hint marker: forces truncation
   - Smart text layout engine with proper width calculations

🔧 **COMPATIBILITY PRESERVED**
🔄 Icon Positioning: Regression addressed while preserving original logic
   - Non-wrap mode maintains existing icon positioning
   - Wrap mode handles icons appropriately
   - Awaiting final UAT confirmation

 ⚠️ DISCLAIMER
================================================================================

This summary reflects the current state of files and implementations as of
2025-09-16. While comprehensive testing and validation have been performed,
additional verification may be needed for production deployment. The fixes
and features implemented have been tested against existing functionality
and appear to restore proper behavior, but full integration testing across
all use cases is recommended.
