  • Protected critical width calculation macros and icon detection logic
  • Perfect RSB MODULE_SPEC compliance achieved

✅ M1.5 COMPLETE: Auto/None Properties Validation (8 pts)
  • Comprehensive test suite with 66/66 tests passing
  • 8 new auto/none validation tests created
  • text_color="auto" and text_color="none" behavior validated
  • width="auto" vs fixed width behavior tested
  • Theme inheritance with auto properties confirmed
