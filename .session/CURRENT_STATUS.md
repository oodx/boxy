# CURRENT STATUS

## Active Branch
- **main** (working wrap logic preserved)
- **showcase-feature** branch contains complete showcase implementation

## Last Completed Task
Successfully implemented `boxy showcase` command with comprehensive documentation updates, discovered width calculation bug affecting box rendering when titles exceed content width.

## Immediate Issue
Width calculation in `src/draw.rs:12-59` doesn't account for title/status length causing box border overflow.

## Quick Context
- Showcase command works but has width bugs
- Normal CLI also affected by same width calculation issue
- All work preserved in showcase-feature branch
- Ready to debug width calculation or continue other work

## Key Files
- `src/draw.rs` - width calculation bug location
- `src/themes.rs` - showcase implementation
